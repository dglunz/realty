                <p class="quote">We sold our home in a little more than 60 days and purchased a new one through Gary and Maureen. 
                To say that we were pleased would be an understatement. Both of them were just fantastic throughout both processes. 
                They were always there for us, explained any question we had, extremely thorough/organized and treated us with the utmost respect. 
                Both my wife and I commented to other people that they really helped us through some trying times. 
                Always friendly and never lost their cool, even in some stressful situations. I personally believe that they were the number 1 reason why we were able 
                to sell our home and purchase a new one in such a short period of time. Both my wife and I would highly recommend them to other people 
                (which we have done already) and would definitely use them again when the time comes to sell our house.</p>

                <p class="quote">My wife and I are experienced home buyers. Over the years we have bought and sold nine homes to live in and more 
                than thirty other pieces of real estate. With all those transactions we have never been better taken care of than by Gary and Maureen Glunz. 
                Whether buying or selling, the Glunz team covers every aspect of the endeavor most effectively and with the highest level of professionalism. 
                We have never felt pressured, yet we could always rely on their many years of experience to guide our decisions.
                We don’t know of any realtors who work harder for you than they do and we couldn’t be happier with the results they have accomplished for us. 
                Gary and Maureen truly make Fountain Hills a better place to live.</p>

                <p class="quote"> We had the privilege to meet Gary and Maureen Glunz in
                2005 when we purchased our first lot in Firerock Country
                Club Community. During the eight years following they
                have sold our home and we purchased another lot through
                them. Gary and Maureen are always kind, caring, wonderfully
                professional and always keep their clients best interest first and
                foremost. We enjoy their ability to know their clients and do everything
                possible to match them with the property they desire. They have an
                extensive knowledge of the area and are always there to see every
                detail is taken care of. Gary and Maureen have become friends and hold a special place in our hearts.</p>

                <p class="quote"> Reasons why we would not hesitate to recommend Maureen and Gary in the process of
                purchasing or selling a home is due to the fact they are both concerned with doing what I learned in Rotary years ago, known as the FOUR WAY TEST:
                  Is it the Truth?
                  Is it Fair to all concerned?
                  Will it build good will and friendships?
                  Will it be beneficial to all concerned?
                  That is the business philosophy they follow and please add honest, knowledgeable, friendly, dedicated, and the willingness 
                  to go the extra mile on your behalf. Simply put, people come and go in Real Estate, but the 
                  Realtors with tenure in the business such as Maureen and Gary exceeded our expectations in assisting with the 
                  purchase of our new home and the sale of our previous home. You will not be disappointed in working with the Glunz’s.</p>
